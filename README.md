# Credit Score Prediction Project

This repository contains code for a Credit Score Prediction project using a RandomForestClassifier. The project leverages a dataset from 'train.csv' to explore relationships between various financial features and credit scores. The visualizations, created using Plotly and Seaborn, provide insights into the distribution of credit scores based on different financial attributes. Feature engineering was performed, and the 'Credit_Mix' column was mapped to numerical values for model training.

## Files

- `credit_score_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model training.
- `train.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and training.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code.
3. Input financial details when prompted to get a predicted credit score from the trained RandomForestClassifier model.

## Summary

This project focuses on predicting credit scores based on various financial attributes. The dataset is explored through visualizations, and a RandomForestClassifier is trained for credit score prediction. Users can input their financial information to receive an estimated credit score. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in predicting creditworthiness, providing insights for both individuals and financial institutions.
